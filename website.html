In the code above, I have added a <style> block within the <head> section to define the CSS styles. The body element has a black background color (#000000) and white text color (#ffffff). The display: flex property is used to center the content vertically and horizontally within the viewport. The height: 100vh ensures that the content takes up the full height of the viewport.

The h1 element contains your name and is placed at the very top. The h2 elements are used for the section headings. The clickable links are styled using the <a> tag, with a white color and some margin for spacing.

Please note that you may need to adjust the padding and font sizes to fit your preferences. Feel free to modify the CSS styles according to your requirements.

Let me know if you need further assistance or have any other questions!

When I open the site up, it is SO dark! How do I make it so it doesn't turn down the brightness?


I apologize for the inconvenience. If you'd like to create a dark mode appearance without affecting the brightness of the user's device, you can use CSS media queries to detect if the user has a preference for dark mode in their system settings. Here's an updated version of the HTML code that incorporates this approach:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>About Me</title>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: #ffffff;
      color: #000000;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      height: 100vh;
      text-align: center;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    h1 {
      margin-top: 0;
    }

    a {
      color: #000000;
      text-decoration: none;
      margin: 10px;
    }

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      body {
        background-color: #000000;
        color: #ffffff;
      }

      a {
        color: #ffffff;
      }
    }
  </style>
